Assignment 4: Group 16 Progress Report
The Story
A kite will be flying in the sky, with a butterfly floating randomly. The sun will be shining, but clouds
will also be floating through the gradient blue sky.

Animated Objects
Three objects are being animated within this sequence – a kite, a butterfly, and a sun.

Length of Sequence
The sequence will continue indefinitely, or until the user clicks stop.

Technical considerations
This animation requires a kite, butterfly, sun, and cloud class. 
The kite class has a kitehead and a kitestring. 
The kite floats across the sky as a whole, a translation, and the kitehead will rotate on a pivot point, where it’s attached to the string, a rotation. 
The butterfly class has a body and wings. The butterfly moves in sin and cos function with different angle of rotating. 
A scale is used to keep the wings amplifying and shrinking to create the feeling of flapping.
The sun's rays rotate around the center, and the sun itself grows and shrinks by changing the width and height of the body.

Work-share and plans for integration
Susan coded the kite. 
Vanessa coded the sun and clouds, as well as creating the gradient for the background.
Jing coded the butterfly.
We all helped put together the different parts to create a cohesive scene.

We created a soccer game simulation using flocking, particle, and physics- based simulations.
The three classes are player, ball, and cloud. The players will have flocking behavior.
They are drawn to the ball, but are limited by how close they can be to each other.
The ball relies on physics to create projectile motion, and the players' movements are dependent on
its x coordinates. The ball also uses gravity and has a force applied to it at the beginning
of its motion which determines its velocity. The clouds follow rules independent of the players and ball,
in which they move towards an anchor point. They darken as they become in proximity with each other,
and double when they reach the anchor point.
Vanessa did the ball, Jing did the players, and Susan did the clouds. 
Unexpected challenges were the scaling of the cloud, which was resolved by changing the radius
of the spheres which make up the cloud.
